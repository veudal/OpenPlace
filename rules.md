## Open Place Guidelines

**Open Place** is a space designed for human collaboration. Any automated activities are not permitted and may be removed.

- **Be Creative and Inclusive:** Have fun and express yourself, but also be considerate of others. Ensure that everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the canvas.

- **Participate in Good Faith:** Open Place is a safe-for-work (SFW) community. Your contributions, whether they are pixels, comments, or posts, should not diminish the experience for everyone.

- **Respect the Community:** Always keep in mind the human element behind every contribution.. Targeted hate, harassment of individuals and attacks on protected groups are violations of our policies and will be removed. Additionally, any posts, comments, or imagery that are hateful, explicit, or otherwise offensive are also against our rules and subject to removal.

Let's work together to create something remarkable and ensure that Open Place remains a positive, creative space for all.
